#  Project Summary

**Title:** Employee Attrition Analysis – Salifort Motors  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Duration:** [e.g., June 2025]

##  Objective

This project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition at Salifort Motors. By exploring key employee metrics, we uncover factors contributing to attrition and build machine learning models to forecast future attrition risks.

##  Key Highlights

- Analyzed satisfaction, performance, hours worked, promotions, and more
- Discovered strong correlations between satisfaction level and attrition
- Built and evaluated models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Achieved high accuracy and F1-scores on test data

##  Insights

- Employees with low satisfaction are most likely to leave
- High working hours without promotion also increases attrition
- Random Forest and XGBoost performed best overall
